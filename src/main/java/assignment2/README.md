# Assignment 2

## 1. REFLECTIONS

### 1.1 Computer mouse

___Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to make sure
that it is of the highest quality.___

* I would test the individual components of the mouse, such as the buttons, the scroll wheel, the laser, etc.

* I would also test the mouse as a whole, by using it on a computer and checking if it works as expected.

* I would test the mouse on different surfaces, to make sure that it works on all surfaces.

### 1.2 Catastrophic failure

___Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe what
happened. Can you identify a test that would have prevented it?___

The Y2K bug is a good example of a software system defect that could have had a bad outcome. The Y2K bug was a bug in
the software
that caused the year to be stored as a two-digit number, which meant that the year 2000 would be stored as 00. This
caused a lot of problems, because the software would think that the year was 1900 instead of 2000.

The whole world feared that this would cause a major catastrophe, with planes falling from the sky, power plants
shutting down, etc.

Luckily, this did not happen, because the bug was discovered in time and fixed.

A test that would have prevented this bug would be a test that checked if the year was stored as a two-digit number or a
four-digit number.
