## 1.2 - Alien

An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)

1. Pick up the toothbrush with your right hand
2. Pick up the toothpaste with your left hand
3. Turn the cap anti-clockwise
4. Squeeze the toothpaste onto the toothbrush
5. Put the toothpaste down
6. Put the toothbrush in your mouth
7. Brush your teeth in a circular motion
8. Continue brushing for 2 minutes
9. Spit out the toothpaste
10. Rinse your mouth with water
11. Rinse the toothbrush
12. Put the toothbrush down

# 2 - Two Katas
Complete the following two katas using TDD. Make sure to follow the TDD mantra,
“red-green-refactor”:
- Red: Write a failing test.
- Green: Write the smallest implementation to make your test pass.
- Refactor: Make the necessary refactoring to the implementation and tests, in
  order to remove code redundancy

A fuller explanation of the TDD steps can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development

Remember, the point of these katas is not to solve the coding tasks as such. The point
is to use TDD. Thus, if your code contains a solution to the task, but no tests, the
solution is not accepted.


## 2.1 - Fahrenheit to Celsius converter
- Use TDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter.
- Use TDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter.

See Java class: `FahrenheitToCelsiusConverter.java`
and test class: `FahrenheitToCelsiusConverterTest.java`

## 2.2 - Roman numerals
Implement an “Arabic numeral to roman numeral” converter using TDD. Follow the
standard form of roman numerals
- The rules can be found on the wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form.
- You can test your converter against this online converter:
